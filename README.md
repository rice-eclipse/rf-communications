# NARWAL: Ground Station Radio for Rice Eclipse

This repo contains the work completed by Eclipse's RF Communications team during the 2022-2023 academic year.

Long-range Amplified Wireless Radio for Aerial Navigation (NARWAL) is Eclipse's first custom radio ground station. It was designed to interface with the Neutro iteration of Real-Time-Rocket (RTR), Eclipse's custom flight instruments package, and to receive telemetry data from RTR during flight.

The work completed by Eclipse's Flight Instruments team in developing RTR can be found [here](https://github.com/rice-eclipse/Real-Time-Rocket).
