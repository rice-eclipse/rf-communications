class MS5803(object):
    '''MS5803-14BA temperature and pressure sensor for Raspberry Pi over i2c.

    This will work for the TE Connectivity MS5803-14BA (14 bar) sensor, whose
    datasheet can be found at https://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=showdoc&DocId=Data+Sheet%7FMS5803-14BA%7FB3%7Fpdf%7FEnglish%7FENG_DS_MS5803-14BA_B3.pdf%7FCAT-BLPS0013.
    This will also work for the SparkFun breakout board (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12909).

    This class allows you to read both the pressure and temperature
    in one simple read() request, or you can use read_raw_pressure(),
    read_raw_temperature(), and convert_raw_readings() functions individually,
    if you need finer-grained control.

    You can read the temp and pressure at different OverSampling Rates (OSR).
    A higher OSR leads to greater resolution/accuracy but requires a longer
    conversion time. The available OSR rates are available in MS5803.OSRs.
    More info on OSR at https://www.cypress.com/file/236481/download.
